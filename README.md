### 📖 Description

A **16-hour hackathon** across various domains where innovation meets execution. Build, collaborate, and push your limits.

---

## 🧠 Project Details (To be filled by participants)

### 🏷️ Project Name:
VigilCare

### 🎯 Chosen Domain:
3️⃣ Digital Health & Predictive Care

### ❗ Problem Statement:
Hospitals often receive incomplete patient context from incoming ambulances, which delays triage and preparation. Routing decisions are also frequently static instead of adapting to nearby hospital options.

### 💡 Solution:
VigilCare provides a live ambulance-to-ER telemetry feed (vitals + AI risk flags) and dynamically suggests two nearby hospitals (suggested + alternative) ranked by ETA (OSRM + buffer). The ambulance dashboard can open Google Maps navigation for each route.
✨ Key Features
Live Telemetry: Real-time ambulance → hospital updates over WebSocket.

AI Triage Alerts: Risk flags based on ECG/SpO2 and derived clinical vitals.

Dynamic Hospital Discovery: Uses OpenStreetMap/Overpass and ETA ranking via OSRM.

Dual Destination Logic: Ambulance dashboard displays both Suggested and Alternate destinations (within 15km).
